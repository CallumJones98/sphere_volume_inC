# Sphere Volume Calculator

This is a simple C program that calculates the volume of a sphere based on a user-provided radius. 

This is part of the coding challenge based in section 2.6 of C programming: A modern approach by K N King. 

The program uses the formula:

\[
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\]

where \(r\) is the radius of the sphere.
